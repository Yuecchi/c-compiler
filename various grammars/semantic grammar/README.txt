This is my second grammar, which supports the following:

● Declaration of integer variables.
● Value assignment to existing variables via expressions.
● Prohibition of variable redeclaration and the use of undeclared variables.
● Evaluation of boolean expressions through both equalities and inequalities.
● Evaluation of arithmetic expressions. Expressions may include a mix of:
	○ Addition
	○ Subtraction
	○ Multiplication
● Expressions are evaluated correctly according to conventional arithmetic operator
semantics and operator priority.


Symbol tables haave also be used in this grammar in order to proibit variable redeclaration
and the use of undeclared variables. Values stored in variables can also be used via the 
symbol table.
