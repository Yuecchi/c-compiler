This is my original grammar which was written without the knwoledge of how to
implement semantic actions in rdp. This grammar is mostly here for reference and
to give an idea of the projects progression. It is also the gramamr which best 
indicates what my intended subset of C will be initially.

This includes:

● Declaration list, both global and local to a function
● Function definitions
● While loops as control flow
● Multiplication and addition
● Return statements with appended expressions

Details of why are included in the report, the "My Initial Grammar" section.
