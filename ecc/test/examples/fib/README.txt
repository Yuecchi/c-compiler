Calculates the first 10 Fibonacci numbers and prints them to the console. I've written this program to demonstrate that the compiler is capable of handling recursive function calls, and the use of functions in expressions. This program also demonstrates the use of local variable declarations, and how variables can be separated by scope (the variable name 'x' is used both for a global variable and a parameter of the fib function).
