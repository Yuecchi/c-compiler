bubs - an example program demonstrating array usage. This program demonstrates:

- An array declared as a local variable using an initializer list to assign elements to the array

- Array elements used in expressions (Boolean expressions in this case)

- Using array elements as both the source and destination of an assignment operation.

It does not demonstrate the following, however it is possible to:

- Declare arrays globally and use them in much the same fashion as in this program.

- Declare arrays in the following ways:
	- int arr[5]; (explicit number of elements but no initializer list)
	- int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3}; (explicit number of elements alongside an initializer list)
