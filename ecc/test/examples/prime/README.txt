This program "attempts" to calculate every prime number up to 2^32 - 1 (I've only actually run it up to about 100,000). This program was mainly written to test whether or not the stack was being manipulated correctly and that programs run for a long period of time would not simply crash due to some unforeseen error (such as the stack blowing due to poor deallocation logic).  It also demonstrates nested loops, use of various operators and local variables.
