TODO

# fix global variables

# add arrays (at some point?)

ISSUES

# global variables currently can't have values assigned
  in the global scope. they need to be precalculated 
  during the parsing phase and their values must then be 
  written to the symbol table file

# it is currently uncertain whether or not functions can be 
  passed as paramters

NOTES

# dynamic stack allocation is still being used for parameters
  this space allocation could be batched with the space allocation
  performed for local variables

# register allocation strategy is flawed and may not work
  in certain cases with bracketed expressions
