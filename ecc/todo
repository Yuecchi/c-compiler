# add arrays

ISSUES

# it is currently uncertain whether or not functions can be 
  passed as paramters

NOTES

# dynamic stack allocation is still being used for parameters
  this space allocation could be batched with the space allocation
  performed for local variables

# register allocation strategy is flawed and may not work
  in certain cases with bracketed expressions
